# Amiga_OldCCode

This repository contains some of my own C and C++ made for the Amiga.
Most of them have to be build using **DCC** someother using **GCC 2.7.0**.

I only corrected some missspellings and something touch the licence. In any case, all those pieces of code are now FOSS under **GPL v3** (even if some source code stats something differents)
